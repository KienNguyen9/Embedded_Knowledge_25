# Autosar Architecture

## Section 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Intro AutoSar in nowday.
Autosar is a demanding standard in the automotive industry, which has become a must know knowledge nowadays.
Autosar architecture is complicated and not an easy topic to understand at the beginning, but if explained in a better way it's quite easy.
- Where do we use AutoSar
- How apply them

The layer of AutoSar
- BSW layer
- Autosar Interfaces
- ASW (Aplication Software)
    - Software components and types
    - Port and port interfaces
        - Sender reciver interface and client server interface
    - Compositions and Connectors
    - Runnables and Events
    - Application software Consolidated summary
- MCAL Layer  
- Autosar RTE Layer(Run-time environment)
    - RTE's API for Sender Reciver and Client-Server Interface\
    - RTE Layer Communication and Scheduling
    - RTE Generator and Tools overview
- Autosar methodologys 
- Design an AutoSar software

### 1.2 How  to approach Autosar 

There are 3 theory:
    1. BSW
    2. ASW
    3. RTE


Demo: Implement
    1. BSW (MCAL, ECU-Abstrection)
    2. ASW
    3. RTE

### 1.3 Introduction to Autosar
Autosar is an Automotive Open System Architecture, which was developed in 2003.

Example, the engine control unit controls the vehicle injection, ignition extra.
Likewise, there are many control units available in the vehicle, which will be calling it as ECUs

About Autosar:
- 9 core partners (GM, Bosch, Toyoda, GM, BMW, Peugeot, VW, Ford, Daimler)
- 39 premium members 
- Development member (Small Companys)
- Associate members (followers)

### 1.4 Neede for AutoSar:
- Easy handling: handling increased complexity of automotive software
- Abstraction: Abstraction of hardware from software, make development more flexible
- Reuseability: reuse software modules across customers
- Fast to market: astablish development distribution among suppliers
- Competition: compete on innovative functions with increased design flexibility

## Section 2 - Base software

### 2.1 Base Software overview

![alt text](.//Images//three_biggest_layer.png)

The Autosar layered architecture is offering (cung cấp) all the mechanisms needed (các cơ chế cần thiết) for software and hardware independence (tính độc lập).
It distinguishes (phân biệt) between three main software layers, which run on a microcontroller.

1. Application Layer
    
    Which be called as ASW
    Functional modules (Application software) that communicate with RTE

2. RTE (Run-time env)
    
    Middleware which realizes the communication between the software components and BSW

3. BSW (Base SW)
    Standardize  SW modules that are necessary for functioning of higher software layer.

4. Micro-controller

Note: 

The main concept of standardised ECU SW achitecture is the separation of hardware independent application SW and  HW oriented BSW by means of a SW abstraction layer RTE
