# Autosar Architecture

## Section 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Intro AutoSar in nowday.
Autosar is a demanding standard in the automotive industry, which has become a must know knowledge nowadays.
Autosar architecture is complicated and not an easy topic to understand at the beginning, but if explained in a better way it's quite easy.
- Where do we use AutoSar
- How apply them

The layer of AutoSar
- BSW layer
- Autosar Interfaces
- ASW (Aplication Software)
    - Software components and types
    - Port and port interfaces
        - Sender reciver interface and client server interface
    - Compositions and Connectors
    - Runnables and Events
    - Application software Consolidated summary
- MCAL Layer  
- Autosar RTE Layer(Run-time environment)
    - RTE's API for Sender Reciver and Client-Server Interface\
    - RTE Layer Communication and Scheduling
    - RTE Generator and Tools overview
- Autosar methodologys 
- Design an AutoSar software

### 1.2 How  to approach Autosar 

There are 3 theory:
    1. BSW
    2. ASW
    3. RTE


Demo: Implement
    1. BSW (MCAL, ECU-Abstrection)
    2. ASW
    3. RTE

### 1.3 Introduction to Autosar
Autosar is an Automotive Open System Architecture, which was developed in 2003.

Example, the engine control unit controls the vehicle injection, ignition extra.
Likewise, there are many control units available in the vehicle, which will be calling it as ECUs
