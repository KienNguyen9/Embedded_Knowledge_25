# Section 2 IDE

## Intro:
- let's understand about Installing an Integrated Development Environment
- IDE is a software that contains all the essential tools to develop, `compile`, `link`, and `debug` your code
- In some cases, you may have to integrate (integrate) compiler and debugger tools to the IDE manually.
- Throughout this course we will be using `Eclipse-based STM32CubeIDE` which is developed by ST Microelectronics
- to write, compile, debug your embedded system applications on STM32 ARM-based microcontrollers.
- STM32CubeIDE is an `eclipse` based IDE with STM32 related customization.

## Features of the IDE
- The very important thing is, it supports all the OS platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) 
- Because, it is based on Eclipse.
- And the next important thing is, it comes with inbuilt cross compilers and debuggers. 
- You need not to download any external compilers or debuggers to integrate (thích hợp) that with this IDE
- everything comes in one single bundle (gói).
- this IDE actually uses a GNU based C C++ compiler for ARM embedded processors. It has a several other

## Installation GNU compiler  
- let's understand installation of GNU Compiler Collections for host.
- So, note that the STM32CubeIDE which we installed in the previous video is an integrated development
- environment software to develop, compile, and debug embedded applications for STM32 microcontrollers.
- the STM32CubeIDE installation procedure (thủ tục) which we carried out in the previous.

- So now we need to install the compiler for our host machine, which doesn't come with the STM32CubeIDE installation
- If you are using Linux or Mac, then it is very simple you just have to run few commands in order to install


```SHELL
install GCC
```
