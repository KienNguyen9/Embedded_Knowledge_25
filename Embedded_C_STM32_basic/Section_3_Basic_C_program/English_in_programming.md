English in programming
- All right. First let's learn some basics syntaxes related to usage of variables 
- and some of the important standard library functions such as printf, scanf, and all. And for this I'll not be using the IDE
- which I installed.
- What I do is, I use one online compiler called onlinegdb which is very much easy to use.
- and it only requires internet connection. So, you can also use this for a time being, later will use 
- our eclipse IDE installed to write programs.

- Of course, you cannot program your target board using this tool, but you can practice some basics syntaxes.
- But for any reason if you can't able to use this online tool, then don't worry at all. You can use the IDE install. 
- Anyway now you already know how to create a project, `compile` it, and `execute`. Right?
- and if you don't have access to internet, then no problem you can always use the offline IDE.
- Let's head over (chuyển sang) to the IDE. 
- And here, let me just create a new project.
- So now, let's click save `in order` (để) to save our project.

- and under that project we have one source file that is called as main.c, which is added by this tool automatically.
- So now, for some people you may not able to see this main.c in that case what you should do is,
- you should go and select this language.
- So, that's why, you have to select appropriate (phù hợp) language here.
- And also if you go to the settings, so you can select the theme dark or light, and editor mode, font size,

- Let's write a simple 'C' program which displays the text
- So, please remember that every 'C' program has at least one function that is called main function.
- So, main is actually the starting point of your program execution. A 'C' program is nothing but collection of various functions and it should contain at least one function and that is called as main function.
- Vì vậy, main thực sự là điểm bắt đầu thực thi chương trình của bạn. Một chương trình 'C' không gì khác ngoài một tập hợp các hàm khác nhau và nó phải chứa ít nhất một hàm và nó được gọi là hàm main.
- So now, let's write the main function. So, don't worry about functions, it's prototype, and other details.
- So, we have separate section for that to understand functions. 
- At this point it would be a too early to explore all those things. So, let's write a main function in our 'C' source file.
- For that, just type the function name that is main,
- and after that you have to put the parenthesis (dấu ngoặc đơn)
- And after that you had to mention the return type of this function, that is actually `int` this is according (dựa theo) to the standard.
- So, according to the C90 and C99 standard main should return int.
- So, that's what standard says.
- So, this is a prototype of the main function
- and this is a function name that is main.
- And now let's give the body of the function.

- So, every function will have its own body and that is identified by these brackets.
 
 we just implemented is actually a function definition?
 So, this is called as function definition, where it has the prototype at the beginning and it has its body.
 So, now inside this body we are going to write code and that code will be executed by the main, when the main function is called
 And in this program our job is just to print the text "Hello World" and in order to print something on
