English in programming
- All right. First let's learn some basics syntaxes related to usage of variables 
- and some of the important standard library functions such as printf, scanf, and all. And for this I'll not be using the IDE
- which I installed.
- What I do is, I use one online compiler called onlinegdb which is very much easy to use.
- and it only requires internet connection. So, you can also use this for a time being, later will use 
- our eclipse IDE installed to write programs.

- Of course, you cannot program your target board using this tool, but you can practice some basics syntaxes.
- But for any reason if you can't able to use this online tool, then don't worry at all. You can use the IDE install. 
- Anyway now you already know how to create a project, `compile` it, and `execute`. Right?
